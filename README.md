# 📎 My Grocery Store Website
This is a dynamic webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript created for lab 3 of SEG3125. This is an adaptive online grocery store website where the users with different requirements can get a personalized shopping list of products. We made sure in this new version that it is more user-centered. Adhering to many rules of ui, we made changes to make our website easier to navigate like adding buttons, better styling, better color choices and adding pictures.
